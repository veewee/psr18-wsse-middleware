/**
 * Revocation is opt-in, and once opted in it is fail-closed: a signer is accepted only when a list that is
 * trusted, current, and issued by the signer's own issuer says nothing about it. Every other outcome: revoked,
 * no list covering that issuer, a list past its nextUpdate, or a list whose signature does not verify against an
 * anchor: rejects. Revocation that silently skips the issuers you forgot to supply is worse than none, because
 * the configuration reads as enabled.
 *
 * Every rejection here asserts the reason, not just the exception type. Every trust failure shares one exception
 * class, so a test that only asserted the class would pass whichever rule fired: and each of these scenarios can
 * fail for more than one reason at once. Asserting the message is what pins the rule under test; the uniform,
 * non-identifying fault a peer sees is produced further out, at the SecurityFault boundary.
