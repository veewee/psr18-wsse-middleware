/**
 * Encrypts the requested parts of the outbound message via XML-Enc. Configuration:
 *   - where the session key comes from, via a SymmetricKeySource: a WrappedSessionKey mints one and carries it
 *     to the recipient in an xenc:EncryptedKey, which is what this block used to do on its own
 *   - which parts to encrypt (default: Body only; override via withParts)
 *   - algorithms (default: the profile carried on the context; override per block)
 *
 * The key source is asked for exactly as many bytes as the data-encryption method takes, and a source already
 * carrying a key of a different width is refused rather than serving one the cipher cannot use.
 *
 * The xenc:ReferenceList naming the encrypted parts is appended to the Security header beside the key rather
 * than inside it, and every xenc:EncryptedData carries a ds:KeyInfo pointing back at the key. That is what lets
 * one key serve this block and a symmetric Signature together: the key is written when it is minted, before
 * either block has said what it will cover.
 *
 * The Security header is guaranteed to exist before the encryptor runs. Algorithm resolution order:
 * per-block override, then the profile carried on the context.
 *
 * Intended position in the outbound list: after Outbound\Signature (sign-then-encrypt). The engine
 * places xenc:EncryptedKey before ds:Signature in the Security header; this block takes no action on it.
