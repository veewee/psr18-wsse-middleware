 * Derives the exclusive-c14n InclusiveNamespaces PrefixList for an element: the namespace prefixes an

 *
 * Exclusive C14N emits only the namespace declarations a subtree visibly uses, which is what makes a
 * signature survive being moved into a different envelope. A peer that needs an ancestor's declaration
 * anyway: because it resolves a QName out of attribute or text content, or re-serializes the message:
 * cannot get it back unless the sender pins it here. Nothing is pinned unless the caller asks for it, so
 * the default output stays the narrowest thing the spec allows.
 *
 * The two entry points differ deliberately, matching the shape a WSS4J peer emits: a signed element pins
 * only what it does not already use, while a container pins everything in scope around it, since the
 * SignedInfo canonicalized inside it is a descendant rather than the container itself.
